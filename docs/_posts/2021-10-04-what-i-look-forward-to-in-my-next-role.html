title: "What I Look Forward To In My Next Role"
---
<p>I have the great privilege of joining the JP Morgan Merchant Services Team starting on Oct. 18th. Any new endeavor brings on vibrancy, opportunity, new relationships, and for me great excitement on how to contribute to the team and make the most of the time spent with folks on the team. Here’s what I’m enthusiastically excited about about this new job:</p> 
<h4>New team, new dream</h4>
<p>The Commercial Banking space will be new to me. I have family members that have worked in the space. They enjoy it, and my Dad shares their passion for the space. This was my intro to the space, and seeing it from a boots on the ground perspective will be riveting (I hope!).</p>
<h4>Opportunity to Grow in the Company</h4>
<p>I’m excited about the chance to grow, to get promoted, to build great relationships with people in the company, to grow in my technical craft, to develop solutions that empower our customers, and to hone my focus. </p>
<h4>What’s Next On The Horizon</h4>
<p>A new endeavor brings with it mystery. For some this brings uncertainty, for me this brings excitement. I’m greatly looking forward to joining the team at JP Morgan, and hope that my comrades are looking forward to having this lil ball of excitement working alongside them as well. </p>

Cheers, </br>
Cole
