<p>Layoffs are never fun. In fact, I mutually agreed to looking for new opportunities with my last employer, exemplifying my naivete for the ease of agreeing on a new job. Courtship is not overnight. ;). Through the search, I came to acknowledge that I was being overly selective with my next role, wanting the perfect job description and responsibilities that perfectly matched my skillset. Here are a couple lessons I learned through the journey of finding my next job:</p><p><b>Financial Planning is Essential</b></p><p>Setting aside essential products for a moment, taking care of your finances is similarly as essential as providing physically for your daily needs. The weight of supporting yourself and your loved ones weighs heavier when the timeline of your means is unknown. Plan ahead for the rainy day. And when you have no other choice, seek help.</p><p><b>Your Circle Will Determine Your Peace of Mind</b></p><p>Having an established network, I got to connecting with everyone who was in a position to open doors. Thankfully, I skirted by on minimums, as a bachelor with no kids on providing for my daily needs. The rainy day fund proved essential here. I pray this doesn’t happen to you, but an interlocked support system, both personally (emotionally) and professionally (opportunistically) is so essential. This is not an overnight process, but cultivating healthy relationships is timely when needed.</p><p><b>Creating income is about solving problems, not pursuing passions</b></p><p>No matter how much you care about what you do, it will not pay the bills until someone is willing to pay for it. Altruism is prevalent in many great people, yet the fact remains that earning your keep is the best job security. I’d love to save every rain forest on planet Earth, I’d also love to have my next meal. The immediacy of the problem weighs on strongly on people’s willingness to pay, and part with money, for their solution.</p><p>Skirting by on a day to day basis boils down to having enough to keep yourself healthy and moving forward (I’d say happy, often overcoming outweighs short-term comfort though). Providing for yourself and your circle financially requires constant maintenance of your financial assets, as well as your relational bonds. Take inventory of your inflows and outflows of your emotional and transactional exchanges today, and project through to the horizon to ensure that tomorrow is a bright day for you and those around you.</p><div><br /></div>
