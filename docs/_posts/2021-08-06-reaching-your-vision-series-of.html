<p>&nbsp;There's a couple components to a vision: timeline, scope, strategy, purpose. These components tie together a visual and a product that casts direction to an organization. When the vision is clear, the path to success is lit up like a street light; when it's blurry, the direction to turn seems foggy, if known at all. What I've learned in my experience in seeking, clarifying, describing, and polishing my own vision, I've distilled these action steps that are necessary to make it happen:</p><p>Reflect</p><p>Evaluate what's created success in the past. History repeats itself, so drawing from our past can give us deepest, clearest clarity on the path forward. Generals in wartime often refer to previous battle strategies when planning their next move. Likewise, business leaders must acknowledge and refer to previous success to color the template of future moves. But the world is always changing, I hear someone say. Methods change and are many; yet, principles never change and are few. Abide by principle-based living and the path ahead gains clarity and direction through reflection into the past. Oftentimes this also means to learn from hard-earned lessons.</p><p>Color</p><p>Fill in the details of the future plan with the new circumstances, tools, people, and goals of today. Babe Ruth is credited with saying "Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games." Take steps to adjust strategy, to think on ideal outcomes, and level-set potential roadblocks and obstacles that may arise throughout the path to accomplishing your objective. While the principles and mindset are common, circumstances and details flex with the time, resources, and tasks at hand. Make note of your inventory, and propel on a path forward with a bias for action; and a built-in time for reflection, repeating the cycle back to step 1. This'll ascend any organization forward to maturity, growth, and improvement to reach its overall aim and impact. That's how a long-term team is formed.</p><p>Reflect</p><p>Evaluate the immediate success or shortcomings of a path. Remember to strive to reach your arms across the finish line. The last stroke is what one Michael Phelps his sixth gold medal in the Beijing olympics in the 100m butterfly. Take that last stroke, and then evaluate the steps that worked, the steps that need improvement (and perhaps seeking outside perspective at this point), and what to do with that information. Perhaps that means incorporating a new tool or process in your planning/executing/tracking processes. Perhaps that means adjusting language used or relational resources used. Whatever your evaluation returns, take it to the next phase of your journey, and onto the next chapter. Remember, your conclusion hasn't been written as long as you've still got a breath.</p><p>The road to accomplishment is never a straight and simple path. It's about learning from prior experiences, adjusting them to the current circumstance, and taking the lessons learned through that journey with you to the next phase. According to , if you do not take action in a 48-hour time period when acquiring new information, the likelihood of retaining that information dwindles to nearly zero. Take action to inspect your processes today, and make sure that you're covering all bases to learn what you can and apply what you've learned. Your long term success and fulfillment depend on it.</p>
